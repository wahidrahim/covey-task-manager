[Stephen Covey's Time Management Grid - the USGS](http://www.usgs.gov/humancapital/documents/TimeManagementGrid.pdf)

As a productivity enthusiast I picked this topic to build an app that *I* would like to use.

I want to see how this app evolves over time. In the end, (when ever that is) it should be fairly robust with features.

[dec 11] updates:
- heroku link: [http://nameless-castle-5087.herokuapp.com/](http://nameless-castle-5087.herokuapp.com/)
- tasks are now sorted by:
    - [quadrants](http://michaelhyatt.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/covey-time-management-matrix.001.001.png)
    - in each quadrant, tasks are sorted by their "mean" which is `(urgency + imoprtance) / 2`. Result: better prioritization.

...

- using bootstrap, I like this better. Still needs optimizing for different screen sizes.
