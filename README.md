[Stephen Covey's Time Management Grid - the USGS](http://www.usgs.gov/humancapital/documents/TimeManagementGrid.pdf)

As a productivity enthusiast I picked this topic to build an app that *I* would like to use.

I want to see how this app evolves over time. In the end, (when ever that is) it should be fairly robust with features.
